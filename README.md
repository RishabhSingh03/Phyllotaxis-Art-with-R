# Phyllotaxis-Art-with-R
The Phyllotaxis Art with R project explores the intersection of mathematics, nature, and art through data visualization in R. Using the concept of phyllotaxis—the arrangement of leaves on plant stems—I created a visually stunning spirals that mimic natural patterns found in flowers and plants. Phyllotaxis is a prime example of how mathematical principles such as the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle can describe natural beauty.

In this project I utilized data visualization techniques to showcase the elegance of these natural patterns. This project mixed creativity with data science, all while deepening understanding of mathematical models in nature.

Data visualization skills learned and used in this project are:

Creating visualizations in R using tools like ggplot2
Implementing the mathematics behind natural patterns
Enhancing R coding skills by generating and manipulating data to represent beautiful shapes
Learning how transformations like rotations and scaling can be applied to create intricate designs
